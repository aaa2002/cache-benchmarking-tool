Strided Access Pattern: Strided access entails accessing a sequence of memory addresses with a consistent and uniform gap (stride) between each referenced address. It can be characterized by the interval between addresses. 


CPU frequency scaling, also known as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), is a technology that allows a CPU to adjust its clock speed and voltage to match the workload, conserving power and reducing heat production during periods of low demand and maximizing performance when needed.
